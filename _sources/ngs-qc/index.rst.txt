Preface
-------

There are many sources of errors that can influence the quality of your sequencing run [ROBASKY2014]_.
In this quality control section we will use our skill on the
command-line interface to deal with the task of investigating the quality and cleaning sequencing data [KIRCHNER2014]_.


.. There is an accompanying lectures for this tutorial (`Next-generation sequencing and quality control: An introduction <https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.2972320.v1>`__).

.. NOTE::

   You will encounter some **To-do** sections at times. Write the solutions and answers into a text-file.

   
Overview

Learning outcomes
-----------------

After studying this tutorial you should be able to:

#. Describe the steps involved in pre-processing/cleaning sequencing
   data.
#. Distinguish between a good and a bad sequencing run.
#. Compute, investigate and evaluate the quality of sequence data from a
   sequencing experiment.
   

The data
--------

First, we are going to download the data we will analyse. Open a shell/terminal.

.. code-block:: bash

   # create a directory you work in
   mkdir analysis

   # change into the directory
   cd analysis

   # download the data
   curl -O http://compbio.massey.ac.nz/data/203341/data.tar.gz

   # uncompress it
   tar -xvzf data.tar.gz

   
.. note::

   Should the download fail, download manually from :ref:`downloads`.


   
The data is from a paired-end sequencing run data (see :numref:`fig-pairedend`) from an |illumina| MiSeq [GLENN2011]_.
Thus, we have two files, one for each end of the read. 

.. _fig-pairedend:
.. figure:: images/pairedend.png

   Illustration of single-end (SE) versus paired-end (PE) sequencing.

If you need to refresh how |illumina| paired-end sequencing works have a
look at the `Illumina
technology webpage <http://www.illumina.com/technology/next-generation-sequencing/paired-end-sequencing_assay.html>`__
and this `video <https://youtu.be/HMyCqWhwB8E>`__.

.. attention::

   The data we are using is "almost" raw data as it came from the machine. This data has been post-processed in two ways already. All sequences that were identified as belonging to the PhiX genome have been removed. This process requires some skills we will learn in later sections. |illumina| adapters have been removed as well already! The process is explained below but we are **not** going to do it.


Investigate the data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make use of your newly developed skills on the command-line to
investigate the files in ``data`` folder.

.. todo::

   #. Use the command-line to get some ideas about the file.
   #. What kind of files are we dealing with?
   #. How many sequence reads are in the file?
   #. Assume a genome size of 12MB. Calculate the coverage based on this formula: ``C = LN / G``


- ``C``: Coverage
- ``G``: is the haploid genome length in bp
- ``L``: is the read length in bp (e.g. 2x100 paired-end = 200)
- ``N``: is the number of reads sequenced
      

The fastq file format
---------------------

The data we receive from the sequencing is in ``fastq`` format. To remind us what this format entails, we can revisit the `fastq wikipedia-page <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format>`__!

A useful tool to decode base qualities can be found `here <http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/explain-qualities.html>`__.


.. todo::

   Explain briefly what the quality value represents.


The QC process
--------------

There are a few steps one need to do when getting the raw sequencing data from the sequencing facility:

#. Remove PhiX sequences
#. Adapter trimming
#. Quality trimming of reads
#. Quality assessment
   

PhiX genome
-----------

`PhiX <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phi_X_174>`__ is a nontailed bacteriophage with a single-stranded DNA and a genome with 5386 nucleotides.
PhiX is used as a quality and calibration control for `sequencing runs <http://www.illumina.com/products/by-type/sequencing-kits/cluster-gen-sequencing-reagents/phix-control-v3.html>`__.
PhiX is often added at a low known concentration, spiked in the same lane along with the sample or used as a separate lane.
As the concentration of the genome is known, one can calibrate the instruments.
Thus, PhiX genomic sequences need to be removed before processing your data further as this constitutes a deliberate contamination [MUKHERJEE2015]_.
The steps involve mapping all reads to the "known" PhiX genome, and removing all of those sequence reads from the data.

However, your sequencing provider might not have used PhiX, thus you need to read the protocol carefully, or just do this step in any case.


.. attention::

   We are **not** going to do this step here, as this has been already done. Please see the :ref:`ngs-mapping` section on how to map reads against a reference genome.


Adapter trimming
----------------

The process of sequencing DNA via |illumina| technology requires the addition of some adapters to the sequences.
These get sequenced as well and need to be removed as they are artificial and do not belong to the species we try to sequence.
Generally speaking adapter trimming takes time.


.. attention::

   The process of how to do this is explained here, however we are **not** going to do this as our sequences have been adapter-trimmed already.
   

First, we need to know the adapter sequences that were used during the sequencing of our samples.
Normally, you should ask your sequencing provider, who should be providing this information to you.
|illumina| itself provides a `document <https://support.illumina.com/downloads/illumina-customer-sequence-letter.html>`__ that describes the adapters used for their different technologies.
Also the |fastqc| tool, we will be using later on, provides a `collection of contaminants and adapters <https://github.com/csf-ngs/fastqc/blob/master/Contaminants/contaminant_list.txt>`__.

Second, we need a tool that takes a list of adapters and scans each sequence read and removes the adapters.
Install a tool called `fastq-mcf <https://github.com/ExpressionAnalysis/ea-utils/blob/wiki/FastqMcf.md>`__  from the `ea-utils suite <https://expressionanalysis.github.io/ea-utils/>`__ of tools that is able to do this.


.. code-block:: bash

   # install
   conda install ea-utils

   
Using the tool together with a adapter/contaminants list in fasta-file (here denoted as ``adapters.fa``):


.. code-block:: bash

   fastq-mcf -o cleaned.R1.fq.gz -o cleaned.R2.fq.gz adapaters.fa infile_R1.fastq infile_R2.fastq 

   
- ``-o``: Specifies the output-files. These are fastq-files for forward and reverse read, with adapters removed.
  

Sickle for dynamic trimming 
---------------------------


We are using a simple program |sickle| for dynamic trimming of our sequencing reads to remove bad quality called bases from our reads. 

.. code:: bash

    conda activate ngs
    conda install sickle-trim

Now we are going to run the program on our paired-end data:

.. code:: bash

    # create a new directory
    mkdir trimmed
    
    # sickle parameters:
    sickle --help

    # as we are dealing with paired-end data you will be using "sickle pe"
    sickle pe --help

    # run sickle like this on the ancestor:
    sickle pe -g -t sanger -f data/ancestor-R1.fastq.gz -r data/ancestor-R2.fastq.gz -o trimmed/ancestor-R1.trimmed.fastq.gz -p trimmed/ancestor-R2.trimmed.fastq.gz -s trimmed/ancestor-singles.fastq.gz
  

.. todo::
 
	#. Run |sickle| also on the evolved samples. 



.. hint::

   Should you not get the command togeter to trim the evolved samples, have a look at the coding solutions at :ref:`code-sickle`. Should you be unable to run |sickle| at all to trim the data. You can download the trimmed dataset `here <http://compbio.massey.ac.nz/data/203341/trimmed.tar.gz>`__. Unarchive and uncompress the files with ``tar -xvzf trimmed.tar.gz``.



Quality assessment of sequencing reads (FastQC)
-----------------------------------------------

      
Installing FastQC
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

    conda activate ngs   
    conda install fastqc

    # should now run the program
    fastqc --help
    

.. code:: bash


                FastQC - A high throughput sequence QC analysis tool

    SYNOPSIS

            fastqc seqfile1 seqfile2 .. seqfileN

        fastqc [-o output dir] [--(no)extract] [-f fastq|bam|sam]
               [-c contaminant file] seqfile1 .. seqfileN

    DESCRIPTION

        FastQC reads a set of sequence files and produces from each one a quality
        control report consisting of a number of different modules, each one of
        which will help to identify a different potential type of problem in your
        data.

        If no files to process are specified on the command line then the program
        will start as an interactive graphical application.  If files are provided
        on the command line then the program will run with no user interaction
        required.  In this mode it is suitable for inclusion into a standardised
        analysis pipeline.

        
FastQC manual
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|fastqc| is a very simple program to run that provides inforation about sequence read quality.

From the webpage:

    "FastQC aims to provide a simple way to do some quality control
    checks on raw sequence data coming from high throughput sequencing
    pipelines. It provides a modular set of analyses which you can use
    to give a quick impression of whether your data has any problems of
    which you should be aware before doing any further analysis."

    
The basic command looks like:


.. code:: bash

          fastqc -o RESULT-DIR INPUT-FILE.[txt/fa/fq] ...

    
-  ``-o RESULT-DIR`` is the directory where the result files will be written
-  ``INPUT-FILE.[txt/fa/fq]`` is the sequence file to analyze, can be more than one file.

   
.. hint::

   The result will be a HTML page per input file that can be opened in a web-browser.

   
.. hint::

   The authors of |fastqc| made some nice help pages explaining each of the
   plots and results you expect to see `here <http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/3%20Analysis%20Modules/>`__.


   

Run FastQC on the untrimmed and trimmed data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. todo::

   #. Create a directory for the results --> **trimmed-fastqc**
   #. Run FastQC on all **trimmed** files.
   #. Visit the |fastqc| website and read about sequencing QC reports for good and bad |illumina| sequencing runs.
   #. Compare your results to these examples (:numref:`fastqc-bad1` to :numref:`fastqc-bad3`) of a particularly bad run (taken from the |fastqc| website) and write down your observations with regards to your data.
   #. What elements in these example figures (:numref:`fastqc-bad1` to :numref:`fastqc-bad3`) indicate that the example is from a bad run?
