Introduction to the command line
=================

Preliminaries
---------------------------------


Note that throughout this course you may see commands or files or directories that are named something like ``my_awesome_file.tab`` or ``my_home_directory`` or ``myresults.txt``. When you see names like this in the instructions, *this does not mean that you should name your files or directories in this way*. Rather, you should replace these placeholder names with names that are **relevant to you**, or which are descriptive **for you**, or which contain **your** directory names. For example, if you are making a file that contains the results of a quality control analysis of DNA sequences from *E. coli*, you might name the file ``ecoli_qc_results.txt``.


.. Attention::
   One important aspect of organising files and directories (folders) is `naming convention <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming)>`_. When working on the command line, your life will become considerably easier if you avoid using spaces in your files and directory names. Thus, **never** name your file ``my awesome file.txt``. Instead, name it ``my_awesome_file.txt`` ("snake case"), or ``myAwesomeFile.txt`` ("camel case") or ``my-awesome-file.txt`` ("kebab case") or ``my.awesome.file.txt`` but probably not ``MY-AWESOME-FILE.txt`` ("screaming snake case"). You should pick one of these at the start of the course, and *stick to that format throughout the course* (i.e. camel case, or kebab case, etc.).


While we are the topic of `naming conventions <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming)>`_, there are certain characters that you should **always** avoid when naming files and folders. Besides spaces, these are (not necessarily exhaustive):


.. code-block:: bash

   : ; ` " ' \ / ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) + , ? [ ] { } | > <
  

In addition to naming conventions, there are good and bad ways to organise your files and directories. Please have a brief read through this resource, ` <https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/developing-bioinformatics-computer/1565926641/ch04.html>`_


.. Attention::
   One More Thing.

   Throughout this course we will be interacting with the computer via the command line. There is one fundamental aspect of using the command line that you **must never forget**. It is perhaps the single most powerful method available to save time. That method is...
   

   **tab-complete**
   

   `Tab-complete <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_completion>`_ can be used to auto-complete commands, directory names, and file names. If you are not sure whether your file is named ``results_QC.txt`` or ``results_qc.txt`` then on the command line you can simply type ``results`` *and then tab*, and the computer will auto-complete the name (assuming there is a file or directory or command that begins with ``results``).

   If you type the first part of a file and then press tab, but find that it does not autocomplete *even though you know you have the correct start of the file name*, then try pressing tab twice. This will give you a list of all the files (directories), etc. that begin with the first few letters that you have typed. This becomes important, for example, if you have a file named ``my_awesome_file.txt`` and ``my_awesome_file2.txt`` but you only type ``my_awes`` and then tab-complete.


.. Attention::
   
   And Yet One More Thing.


   Throughout this lab course, *google is your friend*. If you have errors, or if you are not sure how you might do something, or if you forget a command, google it!

   Thus, **Step One** as you begin the lab is: Approach the command line with confidence and in a calm manner, assured that whatever goes wrong, you can google your way out of it.
